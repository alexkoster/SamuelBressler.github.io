I started this Circle in 2020 as a sort-of covid project, and it has grown by leaps and bounds in the ensuing years. Summaries of the last five counts can be found below; species totals in the 140s are typical.

## Birders of all skill levels are encouraged to join. The count generally takes place the last weekend of December; a signup form will be posted sometime in September.
